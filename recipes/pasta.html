    <p>Bolognese pasta is a hearty and comforting Italian classic made with a slow-cooked meat and tomato sauce. The blend of minced beef, vegetables, wine, and herbs creates a rich flavor that pairs perfectly with pasta — traditionally tagliatelle, although it works great with many shapes. It’s an ideal dish for batch cooking, as the sauce tastes even better the next day.</p>
